Release v2.1.1 (08/09/2011)
 - Updated the configure script to not check for zlib
 - Added the -lz option to CFLAGS
 - Changed the default prefix to /usr/local

Release v2.1 (23/01/2002)
-------------------------
 - Removed a couple of lines of code that could cause segfaults if errors
   were imminent while opening new a file or allocating the buffer memory

Release v2.0 (18/01/2002)
-------------------------
 - Changed from using sys_errlist[] to strerror() (Steve Kondik)
 - Fixed up some problems with Solaris in the configure script.  Thanks to
   Steve Kondik for submitting the patches
 - Added more test cases to the configure script.  It should detect anything
   you need to get httplog to compile, or give you an error saying why not
 - Fixed up some bugs in the configure script.  Thanks to Kenneth Gullberg
   <kenneth@unix.oktan.com> for the fixes and suggestions

Release v1.9 (25/11/2001)
-------------------------
 - Added the ability to create a symlink to the currently active logfile
 - Re-added the RPM .spec file which was removed in v1.8 due to
   incompatibility.  Issue `rpm -ta httplog-1.9.tar.gz' to make an .rpm

Release v1.8 (20/11/2001)
-------------------------
 - Fixed & updated httplog manpage
 - Fixed bug where buffer size was never used, always line buffering
   Thanks to Marcin Deranek <marcin@ripe.net> for noticing the bug
 - Added some extra '%?' tags that httplog parses before the strftime()
   call. %1 = hostname, %2 = domain name, %3 = fully qualified domain name
 - Made up a little configure script, not using autoconf though, all done
   by hand unfortunately, but httplog is small enough that this is ok
 - Got rid of the Makefile, as the configure script generates it when run
 - Changed the install prefix from /var/lib/apache to /opt/apache

Release v1.7 (29/07/2001)
-------------------------
 - Changed SIGTERM reaction from just flushing, to flushing and exiting
   This fixes apache hanging on httplog upon receiving a SIGHUP to restart
 - Added normal error and errno checking to the setvbuf() and time() calls
 - Changed the buffer size (-b) option to be an absolute buffer size value
   This makes it work like it has been described in the README
 - Renamed CHANGELOG to ChangeLog to conform with autoconfs' idea of odd
   CAPITAL NotSoCapital naming conventions to confuse users
 - Added errno code along with normal errors so that you could get a better
   idea of why an error would happen if one did - this is definable code at
   compile time with USE_DEBUG (default is on) Thanks to Andrew Anderson
   <andrew@redhat.com> for this code.
 - Changed the name of MAX_STDIN to BUFSIZ which we used anyways to go along
   with the idea of the MAX_PATH -> PATH_MAX change
 - Changed the name of MAX_PATH to PATH_MAX so we could actually use the kernel
   defined value
 - Changed from having waitpid() run every time in the input loop to catching
   SIGCHLD to clean up the zombie processes (Ben Winslow)
 - Finally added function prototypes and moved stuff around a bit
 - Added error checking to the fork() call for the compression stage
 - Added error checking for compressed filename exceeding PATH_MAX

Release v1.6 (24/06/2001)
-------------------------
 - Changed a typo in the README file regarding a 'delay' option which really
   should have been referring to the buffer size option
 - Changed all examples to show %Y%m%d rather than %d%m%Y for listing reasons.
   %Y%m%d is listed in sequential chronological order
 - Added a startup banner to appear in your error logs, just like Apache does
   when it is restarted.  Also shows httplog version number
 - Added a gzip option so that completed logfiles will be gzipped when httplog
   is done with them and no longer needs to write to the logfile
   Lots of help and fixes with the gzip option from Ben Winslow
 - Added error checking to the localtime() call (Ben Winslow)
 - Changed from using type long to time_t for time() variables (Ben Winslow)
 - Changed variable optopt to curopt to avoid variable shadowing (Ben Winslow)
 - Added child forking for compression and zombie process cleanup with some
   much needed help from Ben Winslow (and many hours reading man pages)
 - Added a compile time define for USE_ZLIB to enable zlib compression
   rather than have it compiled in by default (useless idea?)

Release v1.5 (22/06/2001)
-------------------------
 - Added the ability to change userid/groupip upon spawning of program.   This
   will cause all log files created to be owned by that user/group
 - Added a buffer size option to allow either line buffering mode (buffer size
   of 0) or a user defined buffer size for fully buffered mode

Release v1.4 (06/04/2001)
-------------------------
 - Changed formatting for error messages put out to stderr to match the
   standard Apache error message format found in error logs
 - Corrected a spelling mistake in the 'INSTALL' file where it incorrectly
   listed the Apache command 'apachectl' as 'apachectrl' (dialtone)
 - Increased the buffer size for input on stdin to 8192 (from 2048).  If BUFSIZ
   is defined, that value will be used, otherwise, it will be 8192
 - Added hooks for SIG(HUP|TERM) so that httplog would flush pending logfiles
   to disk before it could possibly lose it

Release v1.3 (21/03/2001)
-------------------------
 - Created CHANGELOG, and INSTALL files, modified README file
 - Modified the absolute path fix to compare pointer addresses rather than
   doing a full blown strcmp (string compare) call

Release v1.2 (20/03/2001)
-------------------------
 - Modified the directory creation code given to me by nathan@0x00.org
 - Fixed problem where an absolute path for logfile template would cause
   program to treat it as a relative path from it's home directory

Release v1.1 (19/03/2001)
-------------------------
 - Changed from open/close of fd method during each line of input to filename
   compare to determine if new fd is required (nathan@0x00.org)
 - Fixed bug where directories would not be created if they were required as
   part of the logfile template (ex, using %D) (nathan@0x00.org)

Release v1.0 (18/03/2001)
-------------------------
 - Initial release
